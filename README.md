madcart
=======

A simple and modern PHP e-commerce platform.

This cart is based on the famous and excelent Opencart.

The purpose of creating a new one is taking it to a new level of awesomeness with the inclusion of production proven technologies like gettext() translations, Modernizr fron-end framework, Jirafe analitics, unit testing, and more...

Also, some code base it's intended to change, for example:
* Better models handling.
* Front/Back-end models fusioning.
* Extensions/modules/widgets diferentiation.
* Template system revamping (better widgetizing).
* Adding controllers helpers for common tasks.
* many more...

Keep on watching and feel free to contribute, comment and debug.
